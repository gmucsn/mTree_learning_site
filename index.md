## Welcome to mTree!

This site will help to introduce the reader to the mTree economics framework. mTree allows researchers to both simulate microeconomic systems and conduct human subject experiments from the same codebase.

### Prerequisites

A first step to using mTree is to either install the mTree Docker container or the mTree Python package.

### Tutorial Videos

In order to understand how mTree works and how to develop microeconomic systems, we have created a number of videos.

1. [Installing mTree with Docker and using the developer tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec2RR1E5Aro)
2. [Discussion of microeconomic system construction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krmr3FQv-Ls)
3. [Running auction examples in mTree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZajGnsv_3I)
